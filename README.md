"# Deep-Learning-Traffic-Light-Recognition" 
I implemented a deep learning structure to detect traffic light colors. In the regularization_test file, I experimented with various regularization methods to optimize the accuracy of the validation set. In the traffic_light_recognition file, I created TensorFlow checkpoints to save the best weights after training and built a CNN model. Additionally, I employed pre-trained models, including ResNet, MobileNet, and VGG, as well as RNN models such as Simple RNN, GRU, and LSTM, to evaluate whether these structures could enhance model performance.
