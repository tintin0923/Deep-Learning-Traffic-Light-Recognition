## Traffic Light Detection Using Deep Learning
### This project implements a deep learning framework for detecting traffic light colors. Key components and methodologies include:

##### Regularization Techniques:  Explored various regularization methods in the regularization_test file to optimize validation set accuracy.
##### CNN and Checkpoints:  Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in the traffic_light_recognition file. Implemented TensorFlow checkpoints to save optimal weights post-training.
##### Utilizing Pre-trained and RNN Models: Integrated several pre-trained models (ResNet, MobileNet, VGG) and recurrent neural networks (Simple RNN, GRU, LSTM) to assess improvements in model performance.
